## Tim's Course Rating: **_( 4.25 / 5 )_**

### <u>Detailed Ratings:</u>

**Captions:** Automatic captions were prone to some inaccuracies, but overall the context clues and onscreen code helped to solve the confusions I had with questionable caption text. _(3.5/5)_

**Ease of Listening:** The instructors had good voice modulation and kept it interesting to listen to them speak. As a cochlear implant user, their accents did take a little getting used to but overall, I would grade this pair high. _(4.5/5)_

**Course Content:** The content of the course was easy to follow and I appreciated the efforts of the instructors to indicate if a topic they touched on was part of the scope of the current module and if not, they did clarify if it was going to be covered later or in another course. This allowed me to do self study on topics I found interesting. _(4/5)_

**Engagement:** I appreciated their honesty of having shortcomings about being creative about their example cases. I can imagine how difficult it is to come up with example projects to show the concepts you are trying to show and these guys did a fantastic job of keeping it simple, reminding the audience to not worry about the naming or the content of the files, but rather how Git worked with these files. I very much appreciated that. _5/5_

**<u>Personal notes</u>**: I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to get a deeper look at Git and Github. My goal of taking this course was to improve my uderstanding of the theory behind some of the more advanced concepts of Git/Github and how collaboration can be achieved within a team/organizational framework, using Git/Github.
